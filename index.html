    Made a navigation bar to switch between pages rather than make a link on the body.
    Added a favicon on both pages and used an image (an airplane) for the list instead of a bulletpoint
    on the destination page. I used the following HTML elements: strong, paragraph, 
    unordered list, heading 1 and 2, and navigation. Added a border on the image in the destination page.

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>For most of my life, I have lived in the US. Although I have lived a good life here, I have only travelled outside the country two times in my childhood. Once I had the financial resources and money, I took my chances and left the country.<br></br>
    I chose a country randomly by closing my eyes and pointing at a map. I landed on Italy. I had no idea what to expect, but I was excited for the adventure. I spent two weeks in Italy, exploring the cities, trying new foods, and immersing myself in the culture. It was an unforgettable experience that sparked my love for travel.<br>
    Since then, I have traveled to several other countries, including <strong>France</strong>, <strong>India</strong>, <strong>Japan</strong>, <strong>Vietnam</strong>, and many more. Each trip has been unique and has taught me something new about the world and myself.<br></br>
    I believe that travel is one of the best ways to broaden your horizons and gain a new perspective on life. It allows you to step out of your comfort zone, meet new people, and experience different cultures. The reason I made this blog is to share my travel experiences and inspire others to explore the world around them.<br>
    So come along with me on my journey as I share my travel stories, tips, and recommendations. I hope to inspire you to take that leap of faith and explore the world for yourself!
