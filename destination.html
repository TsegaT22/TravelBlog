            <h2>Visitor Tips</h2>
            <ul class="visitor-tips">
                <li><strong>Best Time to Visit:</strong> August to January to experience some of Ethiopia's holidays and Ashenda, a holiday in the Tigray region that celebrates girlhood.</li>
                <li><strong>Local Cuisine:</strong> Try traditional dishes like injera with various stews (wat) and Mek'ele's national food, Tihlo. Tihlo is edible dough-like food shaped into balls and is eaten with Selsi, a spicy meat stew.</li>
                <li><strong>Transportation:</strong> Use local minibuses or taxis for getting around the city. I highly recommend getting a travel guide.</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural Etiquette:</strong> Dress modestly and ask permission before photographing people.</li>
                <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Stay informed about local conditions and follow travel advisories.</li>
